/**
 * Main takeaways: 
 * 
 * 1: String slices are references to parts of a String. The data structure 
 * essentially consist of length (number of slots) and a pointer pointing 
 * towards an array in memory. 
 * 
 * 2: "danger()" explains a very interesing error scenario where we modify the
 * basis for a function result making the result incorrect. Slicing solves this. 
 * 
 * 3: Slices are more general than the full class. For example in first_word()
 * using &str for argument type is better than using &String because it can 
 * now accept both full Strings and slices. This is due to a full String 
 * being considered the same as a string sliced from start to end of the String.
